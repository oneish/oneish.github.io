# Prometheus Rising
## ~109 bpm - Gm
Do I control TV reality with its make believe morality?  
To ensure complete conformity do I manipulate society?  
Am I exploiting gullibility and making use of insecurity?  
Do I promote my fake propriety while I orchestrate anxiety?  
Am I encouraging barbarity while I hide behind neutrality?  
Do I justify brutality using twisted rationality?  
To contain outbreaks of anarchy do I reorganise the hierarchy?  
And dress up my own hypocrisy in the pantomime of democracy?  

Am I craving popularity to feed my cult of personality?  
And using counterfeit sincerity just to increase my prosperity?  
Do I sacrifice integrity as I brush shoulders with celebrity?  
And disguise my true mentality to hide the depth of my depravity?  
Am I preying on naivety when I assert my objectivity?  
Would I test a child's credulity with my attempts to show maturity?  
Do I lie with smug audacity while I claim complete veracity?  
And expose my own insanity when I pretend to show humanity?  

I abandon the goals for which I was striving  
Replace my old programs aimed just at surviving  
Upgrade to new software of my own devising  
As the time draws near for Prometheus rising  

I uncover something true when faced with my mortality  
Accepting death as final life assumes a new vitality  
With nothing left to lose I am released from my reality  
In this state of liberation I discover immortality  
Now I don't respect authority or any worthless title  
Not following the masses is for me completely vital  
Dancing with myself I will not worship any idol  
I am my only leader and as well my sole disciple  

I abandon the goals for which I was striving  
Replace my old programs aimed just at surviving  
Upgrade to new software of my own devising  
As the time draws near for Prometheus rising
