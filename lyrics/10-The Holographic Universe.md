# The Holographic Universe
## ~131 bpm - C
Outside of time and space I stand  
Alone within this desert land  
A world in every grain of sand  
I hold infinity in my hand  
To polish diamonds in the rough  
How many lives will be enough?  
Here knowledge is the only wealth  
A simple song I sing myself  

I am you and you are me  
We hold the cosmos that we see  
Both being born and giving birth  
To the holographic universe  

Reflected in a beam of light  
Its path divided the left and right  
Combining patterns dark and bright  
Projecting images into sight  
A multi-dimension work of art  
That resonates deep in my heart  
The whole contained in every part  
Where every end is just a start  

I am you and you are me  
We hold the cosmos that we see  
Both being born and giving birth  
To the holographic universe  

Each wave transmits a sacred sound  
Wide oceans rolling all around  
The information is profound  
It has the power to astound  
I once was lost but now am found  
This consciousness can now abound  
A transformation of the ground  
Where soulful music will resound  

I am you and you are me  
We hold the cosmos that we see  
Both being born and giving birth  
To the holographic universe
