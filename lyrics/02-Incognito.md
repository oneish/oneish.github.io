Incognito								127 bpm	C

You were in my dream last night
Subconscious vision filled with delight
You turned a key inside my head
My only thought of you in bed
You captured me with your first glance
I fell so deep into a trance
Unconsciously you cast a spell
Will you lead me to heaven or leave me in hell?

A feeling emerges and begins to grow
Irresistible urges so hard to veto
Taken by surprise my will overthrown
My desire awakens my alter ego
My heart takes flight my soul overflows
Surrendering control to my libido
A stronger attraction than I've ever known
A chemical reaction incognito

You and I at last combined
Among the stars we dance entwined
Intoxication in my mind
A place that words will never find
Your eyes are filled with expectation
Your touch creates intense sensation
My body responds to stimulation
My brain explodes in pure elation

A feeling emerges and begins to grow
Irresistible urges so hard to veto
Taken by surprise my will overthrown
My desire awakens my alter ego
My heart takes flight my soul overflows
Surrendering control to my libido
A stronger attraction than I've ever known
A chemical reaction incognito

A perfect match genetically
Hard wired in neural circuitry
You're flooding my brain chemistry
Could this dispel the mystery?
Addicted to your drug so pure
You give me fever you are the cure
Whatever will be one thing is sure
This flame will burn for evermore

A feeling emerges and begins to grow
Irresistible urges so hard to veto
Taken by surprise my will overthrown
My desire awakens my alter ego
My heart takes flight my soul overflows
Surrendering control to my libido
A stronger attraction than I've ever known
A chemical reaction incognito
