# Real Magic
## ~129 bpm	- C
Earth keeps on spinning through time and through space  
I hear the air whisper feel the wind on my face  
Fire lights up the sky with a bright lightning flash  
Water rises and falls as ocean waves crash  
Departing my body it becomes incidental  
As I open my mind to the transcendental  
The spirit of life is the one fundamental  
Inside as outside forces are elemental  

Here I share my premonition  
All of our dreams brought to fruition  
With selfish goals it might seem tragic  
When everyone wins we feel real magic  

Begin to develop some psychic ability  
Transmit and receive with mental telepathy  
Thoughts synchronise interlocking coherently  
Ideas coincide expressing deep unity  
Minds intertwine to form a new entity  
With nothing to hide there's no need for secrecy  
The light shines away the illusion of privacy  
Revealing the knowledge of our one true identity  

Here I share my premonition  
All of our dreams brought to fruition  
With selfish goals it might seem tragic  
When everyone wins we feel real magic  

Wandering through an enchanted forest  
Where memories echo from deep in the past  
Remember once more events that we cherished  
Along with some times we thought we were lost  
Enter a clearing where all the paths meet  
With every choice a gain and a cost  
Try to decide what we really need  
Carefully weighing the pros and the cons  

Many ways are wending from this point of interaction  
Desires concentrating on our future satisfaction  
Atoms all relating through the forces of attraction  
Thoughts keep on ascending higher levels of abstraction  
Decisions are creating instantaneous transactions  
Moments keep extending spanning shorter time fractions  
The cause of this mind bending is affecting every action  
The sense of time dilating reveals the web of life's reaction  

We visualize our chosen direction  
Ideas realised through clear intention  
Each word we speak is an incantation  
A seed to feed our imagination  
Beliefs direct our mind's perception  
A universe formed of thought reflection  
The world confirms our expectation  
We've already reached our destination
