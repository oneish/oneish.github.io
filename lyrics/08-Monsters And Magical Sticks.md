# Monsters And Magical Sticks
## ~99 bpm - Bb
Long ago I knew a man  
And he told me his story  
In case I recognised my life  
In his quest for love and glory  
He had travelled far and wide  
Exploring many strange directions  
Always searching for the truth  
In its infinite dimensions  

As a child he somehow knew  
There were some things they hadn't told him  
And as his stature grew  
He knew this world would never hold him  
One day he found a love so true  
That he thought it could dissolve him  
And while he didn't have a clue  
He dreamt her body would enfold him  

When first he tried to win her heart  
She seemed to entertain the notion  
But his world was torn apart  
When she rejected his devotion  
His friends said she was a tart  
For disregarding his emotion  
But his recovery could start  
If he would try their magic potion  

His mind was blown away  
By this new discovery  
As he left behind his pain  
Forgetting all about life's drudgery  
While he wondered about his brain  
He found another side to life  
Letting go of all his doubts  
He heard the music come alive  

As we follow the winding path  
Someone somewhere is having a laugh  
Just beware of all their tricks  
All their monsters and magical sticks  

Leaving for a distant town  
He waved his family goodbye  
It was in a crazy time  
When many people kissed the sky  
Among the factories and grime  
In the house they built on Albion  
Finding god he lost his mind  
Searching for a state more halcyon  

Returning to his place of birth  
Where the cult declared their love  
He was fooled by holy words  
That seemed to fit him like a glove  
Renouncing all attachment  
Joining their religious club  
He gave up his favourite herb  
And stopped listening to dub  

For many years he did abstain  
From pleasures and temptations  
His friends thought he'd gone insane  
With his chants and meditations  
Inside he searched for higher planes  
And tried to draw his own conclusions  
At last he saw right through their games  
And broke the spell of their illusions  

His eyes open once again  
Awakened from a deep delusion  
Readjusting to the world  
He found he suffered some confusion  
Still he harboured no regrets  
From his attempts to reach salvation  
And kept on seeking out the light  
That might reveal his true vocation  

As we follow the winding path  
Someone somewhere is having a laugh  
Just beware of all their tricks  
All their monsters and magical sticks
