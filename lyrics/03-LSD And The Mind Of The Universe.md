# LSD And The Mind Of The Universe
## ~107 bpm	- Gm
I take my first initiation  
A psychedelic preparation  
Higher awareness exploration  
I travel through mind transformation  
A state of consciousness expansion  
Where life reveals a new dimension  
I sense my own enhanced perception  
In nature's plan I sense perfection  

I set sail on a voyage to the core of my being  
I pass through the veil into the vision I'm seeing  
The meaning is clear in the scene I behold  
I go with the flow as the story unfolds  
All personal issues I learn how to transcend  
The life that I knew has now come to an end  
I let myself go until I'm all gone  
When this journey is over I shall be reborn  

Revealed through nature's inspiration  
The mystery of life's creation  
With joy of newfound liberation  
This trip becomes a celebration  
I'm tuning in to good vibrations  
Expressing deep appreciation  
I trust my inner navigation  
It's leading me to realisation  

I set sail on a voyage to the core of my being  
I pass through the veil into the vision I'm seeing  
The meaning is clear in the scene I behold  
I go with the flow as the story unfolds  
All personal issues I learn how to transcend  
The life that I knew has now come to an end  
I let myself go until I'm all gone  
When this journey is over I shall be reborn  

Is this a mere hallucination?  
A trick of my imagination?  
What is the real interpretation?  
Where can I find an explanation?  
The sky is filled with constellations  
The stars provide illumination  
As I discover confirmation  
Of universal integration  

I set sail on a voyage to the core of my being  
I pass through the veil into the vision I'm seeing  
The meaning is clear in the scene I behold  
I go with the flow as the story unfolds  
All personal issues I learn how to transcend  
The life that I knew has now come to an end  
I let myself go until I'm all gone  
When this journey is over I shall be reborn
