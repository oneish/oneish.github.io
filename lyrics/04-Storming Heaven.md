Storming Heaven							137 bpm	Bb

We're all having a get together
And enjoying the summer weather
On the beach in the park or wherever
We've been waiting for this forever
We exchange all our buried treasure
As we set off in pursuit of pleasure
Having fun is our only endeavour
We'll be dancing until whenever

We are the latest generation
Embodying our genes' expression
The product of Earth's cultivation
Evolving is our main obsession
We have devised our own mutation
The pinnacle of life's progression
This party is our graduation
We are the species storming heaven

Our destination has been decided
By inner voices we have been guided
A chance to play and to get excited
Knowing that everyone has been invited
Our minds are joined we are not divided
Now that this venue has been provided
The walls dissolve and we are united
It might seem crazy but we are delighted

We are the latest generation
Embodying our genes' expression
The product of Earth's cultivation
Evolving is our main obsession
We have devised our own mutation
The pinnacle of life's progression
This party is our graduation
We are the species storming heaven

Can global synchronicity help us grasp this possibility?
And seize the opportunity to create a new community
With unprecedented clarity we can sense the one reality
Direct perception of eternity is now dawning on humanity
Light sound divinity initialise this holy trinity
Condensation of infinity within the realm of relativity
The source of creativity consumed in this activity
The cause of our festivity undiluted positivity

We are the latest generation
Embodying our genes' expression
The product of Earth's cultivation
Evolving is our main obsession
We have devised our own mutation
The pinnacle of life's progression
This party is our graduation
We are the species storming heaven
