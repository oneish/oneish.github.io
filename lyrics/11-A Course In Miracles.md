# A Course In Miracles
## ~111 bpm - Gm
Talking to myself  
Reflecting on communication  
I came across a book  
A boundless source of inspiration  
As we walk upon this earth  
Brothers sisters one and all  
I look forward to the day  
Each of us will heed the call  

Nothing real can be threatened  
Nothing unreal exists  
We return back to the pinnacle  
As we take a course in miracles  

How many years have passed  
Since we set out on our voyage?  
Have we found the proof we sought  
For the source of all our knowledge?  
Contemplating what we've seen  
So far beyond the physical  
How can we know what life means  
If we're still so egotistical?  

Nothing real can be threatened  
Nothing unreal exists  
We return back to the pinnacle  
As we take a course in miracles  

Like a half remembered dream  
This journey could seem mythical  
The way a long forgotten scene  
Might look to one more cynical  
Are things really as they seemed?  
So strange and deeply mystical  
Can we still recognise the theme?  
Once so clear and unequivocal  

Home again  
In calm eternity  
Thy will is done  
Now all is one
