# Astral Dynamics
## ~121 bpm - Am
My muscles relaxing my senses enhanced  
I see patterns evolving wherever I glance  
I hear the air buzzing my attention entranced  
I feel energy rushing as my molecules dance  
Stepping out of my body and into the dream  
I turn off my mind and it floats off downstream  
My vision is flooded with colours that gleam  
My thought becomes one with this beautiful scene  

As we are enlightened by astral dynamics  
The view that we share becomes panoramic  
My mind now at peace and time standing still  
Remember this moment as I always will  

Plucked from the planet and sucked into space  
I head for the stars with incredible pace  
The Earth falls away the sky I embrace  
Irresistibly drawn to this heavenly place  
My higher self guides me my mind is wide open  
I encounter the word that can never be spoken  
I now see the point of the life I have chosen  
I stay here forever where time remains frozen  

As we are enlightened by astral dynamics  
The view that we share becomes panoramic  
My mind now at peace and time standing still  
Remember this moment as I always will  

Bathed in the light of an unending day  
Brilliant wisdom pours out of each ray  
There's nothing I need and nothing to say  
The last of my ego has drifted away  
In every direction I see simultaneously  
This singular vision extends to infinity  
All questions I have are answered immediately  
We are all one the truth is revealed to me  

As we are enlightened by astral dynamics  
The view that we share becomes panoramic  
My mind now at peace and time standing still  
Remember this moment as I always will
