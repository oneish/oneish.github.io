The Cosmic Serpent							119 bpm	Am

Right from the start of me
Deep in the heart of me
In every part of me
The view of this world that I see
The person I was bound to be
The source of my reality

The seed from which we grew
Has become the fruit
On the tree of life
The code we reproduce
Twists back to the root
Keeping us alive

We hear the song you wrote
And sing it note for note
With every living thing
The perfect synthesis
Of all that human is
In every human being

Did we begin our odyssey
Off in some distant galaxy?
Who spun the thread of history
Now weaving life's rich tapestry?
What will it take to turn the key
Escape our cells and set us free?

Mad Hatter brews a pot for me
Of his disgusting magic tea
It's snakes and ladders best of three
With Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Unravelling the mystery
The river flows into the sea

I'm floating through the open door
And rowing out beyond the shore
Advancing further to explore
The meaning in the metaphor
No longer dreaming anymore
Never felt this awake before

Fluorescent colours streaming by
My intuition tells me why
A spiral staircase to the sky
Is passing through my inner eye
The cosmic serpent climbing high
Is showing us how we can fly
