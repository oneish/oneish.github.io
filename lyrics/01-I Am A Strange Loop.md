# I Am A Strange Loop

She might be a scientist  
There is no way of proving this  
She could be a physicist  
And still not know that I exist  
Maybe a top neurologist  
Would find my mind hard to resist  
If she's a trained psychologist  
Then my free will will not be missed  

With the logic of a mathematician  
She pounds my brain into submission  
How can I make my own decision?  
She makes me beg for her permission  

I am a strange loop  
She's easy to adore  
I try to break on through  
She opens up the door  
I taste her witches brew  
She knows I want some more  
I ask her for the truth  
She tells me what's in store  
When I go through the roof  
She leaves me on the floor  
I ask her what to do  
She takes me home once more  

She's worked her way inside my brain  
Her thoughts are driving me insane  
She's using pleasure spiked with pain  
At first it's sunshine then it's rain  
She likes to taunt and tease her men  
She wields the sword she wields the pen  
She tells me secrets now and then  
And sends me back to start again  

With stories of pinball collisions  
She leads me to determinism  
Where can I find my own volition?  
If all she's left me is cognition  

I am a strange loop  
She's easy to adore  
I try to break on through  
She opens up the door  
I taste her witches brew  
She knows I want some more  
I ask her for the truth  
She tells me what's in store  
When I go through the roof  
She leaves me on the floor  
I ask her what to do  
She takes me home once more
